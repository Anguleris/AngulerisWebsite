	<h1><u>SERVICES AND DELIVERABLES TERMS AND CONDITIONS</u></h1>
	<p>
		This Agreement is entered into by and between Client and Anguleris Technologies, Inc., an Illinois corporation (hereinafter referred to as (“AGT”) 
		located in Carpentersville IL. These terms and conditions govern all work performed for Client by Anguleris and are incorporated into each and every 
		Scope of Work and Proposal for Services entered into between Client and AGT. Any different or different terms and conditions are hereby rejected. 
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="cjoParagraphHeader">1. Scope of Work. </span> 
		Client hereby retains AGT to provide on a timely and collaborative basis the services described in one or more Statements of Work signed by an 
		authorized representative of each party (hereinafter referred to as “SOW”). Each SOW shall be incorporated by reference into, and will be governed 
		by the provisions of, this Agreement. AGT will not bill Client for any work that is not authorized by a SOW. Each SOW will describe the services 
		to be performed (“Services”), the deliverables to be provided (“Deliverables”), the schedule, the charges and such additional information as the 
		parties agree upon in writing. In the event of inconsistency between this Agreement and a SOW, the SOW will govern as to the inconsistent matter(s). 
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="cjoParagraphHeader">2. Term. </span> 
		The term of this Agreement shall commence on the effective date set forth above and continue until the date this Agreement is terminated as provided 
		below. Termination of a SOW will not terminate the entire Agreement unless so stated in the termination notice. 
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="cjoParagraphHeader">3. Change Orders. </span> 
		If either party desires a modification to the Services, Deliverables, schedule or charge set forth in a SOW, or the addition of out-of-scope work to a 
		SOW, or any other terms within the SOW, such party will submit its requested modifications in writing to the other party. The recipient of requested 
		modifications may accept or reject the requested modifications, or present a counter-proposal, in its sole discretion. AGT may bill Client, on a time 
		and materials basis, for the work involved in analyzing the impact of any modification proposed by the Client provided the cost is agreed to in writing 
		in advance of the work. Changes to a SOW will be effective only when an authorized representative of each party executes a written amendment to the SOW 
		that sets forth the changes to the Services or Deliverables and any related changes to the schedule and charges (a “Change Order”). AGT will not begin 
		any Change Order work until a Change Order is fully executed by both parties. 
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="cjoParagraphHeader">4. Acceptance. </span> 
		The parties agree that acceptance criteria for any Services or Deliverables should be set forth in each SOW. Promptly following AGT’s completion of any 
		Services or delivery of any Deliverables, Client will examine the Services or Deliverables to confirm conformance with specifications. Subject to 
		paragraph 5 below, if AGT has not received written notice from Client identifying problems, defects, errors or omissions within ten (10) business 
		days following completion of the Services or delivery of the Deliverables, the applicable Services or Deliverables will be deemed accepted by Client. 
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="cjoParagraphHeader">5. Correction of Services and Deliverables. </span> 
		If there are any problems, defects, errors or omissions in Services or Deliverables provided by AGT within ninety (90) days after the Services or 
		Deliverables are delivered to the Client, Client shall provide written notice thereof to AGT and AGT shall make necessary corrections or replacements 
		in a timely manner as originally set forth in the SOW, without additional charges; or if it is not practical to correct the nonconformities, as determined by AGT in its sole discretion, AGT will refund the price of the nonconforming Services or Deliverables. This is Client’s sole and exclusive remedy with respect to non-conforming Services and Deliverables. 
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="cjoParagraphHeader">6. Personnel, Work Rules, and Conduct. </span> 
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="cjoParagraphHeader">6.1 Conduct Requirements. </span> 
		With respect to any work performed on Client premises, Client will provide AGT with written copies of any and all applicable policies 
		and procedures, including without limitation those that govern safety and security, use of equipment, sexual harassment and non-discrimination, 
		alcohol and drug use, and integrity so that any personnel supplied by AGT will be aware of Client’s rules and standards regarding workplace conduct. 
		Client will also report to AGT any alleged violation of Client’s workplace conduct rules and standards involving any AGT personnel and cooperate with 
		AGT in any investigation of an alleged violation of such rules and standards.  
	</p>
	<p>
		 AGT and Client agree that if the alleged violation is a result of the action or inaction of Client, AGT shall have no liability as a result of 
		 said violation. AGT and Client further agree that should it be determined that the alleged violation is a result of the action or inaction of AGT, then 
		 it shall assume responsibility and shall indemnify and hold harmless Client from any third party claim for liability incurred as a result of said violation. 
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="cjoParagraphHeader">7. Termination Without Cause </span> 
		Either party may terminate this Agreement upon thirty (30) days’ advance written notice. Furthermore, unless otherwise stated in the applicable SOW, 
		either party may terminate a SOW upon thirty (30) days’ advance written notice. In that event, AGT will advise Client of the extent to which performance 
		has been completed and deliver any work in progress. AGT will be paid for all work performed in a satisfactory manner and consistent with an approved SOW 
		on a time and material basis and will be reimbursed for expenses incurred to perform such work through the date of termination, including charges for materials 
		ordered by AGT that cannot be returned for a full refund. If Client terminates a SOW or the Agreement without cause while any SOW remains uncompleted, Client 
		will pay any cancellation fee applicable to the affected SOW, in addition to or in lieu of such time and materials charges, provided such charge is set forth 
		in such SOW.  
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="cjoParagraphHeader">8. Termination for Cause </span> 
		Either party may, without prejudice to the other rights or remedies available to it, immediately terminate this Agreement if the other party:  
		<ol type="a">
			<li>
				fails to perform its obligations under this Agreement or any SOW and such failure continues for a period of seven (7) business days after written notice; 
			</li>
			<li>
				ceases to carry on its business substantially as such business was conducted on the date of this Agreement; 
			</li>
			<li>
				institutes or suffers the institution against it of bankruptcy, reorganization, liquidation, receivership, insolvency or similar proceedings; or 
			</li>

				becomes generally unable to pay its debts as they become due. 
			</li>
		</ol>
	</p>
	<p>
		 Additionally, AGT may suspend work or terminate this Agreement or any SOW if Client: 
		 (a) fails to pay undisputed amounts to AGT within fifteen (15) days of AGT’s written notice specifying the undisputed amounts 
		 (b) Fails to communicate with AGT or to provide requested information for a period of ninety (90) days after request by AGT.

	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="cjoParagraphHeader">9. Independent Contractor. </span> 
		AGT is an independent contractor and nothing in this Agreement will be construed to make AGT or any of its employees performing services pursuant 
		to this Agreement or any SOW, the agent or employee of the other. No officer, director, employee, agent, affiliate or contractor employed by AGT 
		performing work on Client’s behalf under this Agreement will be deemed to be an employee, agent or contractor of Client. Neither party will have 
		any right, power or authority, express or implied, to bind or make representations on behalf of the other.  
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="cjoParagraphHeader">10. Compensation and Charges for Services. </span>
		Client will compensate AGT for Services and Deliverables performed in a satisfactory manner and, for necessary, incurred expenses as set forth in 
		this contract and each SOW. 
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="cjoSubParagraphHeader">10.1 Time and Materials. </span>
		Client will make payments at the hourly rates or for the agreed fixed price set forth in the applicable SOW, exclusive of sales, 
		use and similar taxes. Client acknowledges and agrees that travel time to and from Client’s site will be billable unless related to problems, 
		defects, errors or omissions in AGT’s Services or Deliverables. AGT will determine if travel or if on-site work is required. 
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="cjoSubParagraphHeader">10.2 Invoice and Payment </span> 
		AGT will invoice charges for third-party materials purchased pursuant to a SOW upon delivery of such materials to Client. AGT will 
		invoice charges for Services or Deliverables, together with applicable taxes, provided on a monthly basis. AGT will invoice charges 
		for Services or Deliverables provided on a fixed price basis in accordance with the agreed payment schedule set forth in the applicable SOW. 
		All invoices will identify the individual involved, the hours worked and the dates for each charge. Except for amounts reasonably disputed by 
		Client, Client will pay the invoice within thirty (30) days from the date of invoice. Any disputed amounts by Client will be handled in accordance 
		within the Dispute Escalation Procedure contained within each SOW. Client must raise any concern or dispute in writing within ten (10) days from the 
		date of the invoice or the invoice will be payable. Client’s dispute of any amounts will not delay its payment of undisputed charges and expenses to 
		AGT. If Client defaults in payment of any sum due AGT, AGT may suspend further performance under any or all SOWs and will be entitled to receive all 
		amounts within the retention account for any/all SOWs within five (5) days of notification.  
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="cjoSubParagraphHeader">10.3 Taxes and Expenses </span> 
		AGT will charge Client for any taxes imposed on AGT for State or local sales, use, gross receipts, and ad valorem taxes, duties or similar charges 
		imposed directly on the Services or Deliverables (exclusive of taxes based on the property or net income of AGTs). Unless expressly set forth in a 
		SOW as included in a fixed price, Client will reimburse AGT for reasonable and necessary out-of-pocket expenses such as long distance telephone charges, 
		postage, shipping, and reasonable travel and living expenses; provided, however, that travel and living expenses shall be approved in advance by Client.

		As used herein, “Confidential Information” means any and all non-public technical or business information, including third party information, 
		furnished or disclosed by one party (the “Disclosing Party”) to the other party (the “Receiving Party”) that, if in a tangible medium, the 
		Disclosing Party has marked as “confidential”, “proprietary” or similarly at the time of disclosure and that, if disclosed orally, the Disclosing 
		Party indicates as confidential or proprietary at the time of disclosure and subsequently, within twenty (20) days after the date of such oral 
		disclosure, confirms as confidential or proprietary in a writing sent the Receiving Party that describes the information that is to be kept confidential. 
		Each party will maintain all Confidential Information it receives from the other in confidence using commercially reasonable standards and no less care 
		than it uses with its own information, and will use and disclose such information only as contemplated by this Agreement or as authorized by the Disclosing
		Party. Each party will require its personnel to do likewise. These obligations do not apply to information that: (a) is generally available to the public 
		other than by a breach of this Agreement; (b) is rightfully received from a third party lawfully in possession of the information and not subject to a 
		confidentiality or nonuse obligation; (c) is independently developed by the Receiving Party or its personnel, provided the persons developing the 
		information have not had access to the information of the Disclosing Party; or (d) was already known to the Receiving Party prior to its receipt 
		from the Disclosing Party. In addition, the Receiving Party will be allowed to disclose Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party to the extent 
		that such disclosure is: (x) approved in writing by the Disclosing Party; (y) necessary for the Receiving Party to enforce its rights under this 
		Agreement in connection with a legal proceeding; or (z) required by law or by the order of a court of similar judicial or administrative body, provided 
		that the Receiving Party notifies the Disclosing Party of such required disclosure promptly and in writing and cooperates with the Disclosing Party, at 
		the Disclosing Party’s reasonable request and expense, in any lawful action to contest or limit the scope of such required disclosure. Notwithstanding 
		anything to the contrary above, all information concerning donors, clients, listeners or students of the Client shall be considered Confidential 
		Information. Upon termination of this Agreement at the Disclosing Party’s request, the Receiving Party will promptly return any Confidential 
		Information of the other party or destroy such at the request of the Disclosing Party.

		<span class="cjoParagraphHeader">17. No Agency or Third Party Benefits </span>
		This Agreement does not create any agency relationship between parties, and AGT shall not have authority to bind or obligate Client to any 
		third parties. This Agreement is not intended to create any benefit of right in any person, firm or entity not a direct party to this Agreement. 
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="cjoParagraphHeader">18. Electronic Records. </span>
		This Agreement may be implemented by electronic means, including by facsimile, email, text, and any and all other recognized and mutually 
		agreeable forms of electronic communication. All such transmissions will be effective when received. All such transmissions shall be deemed 
		to be writings for all purposes.
